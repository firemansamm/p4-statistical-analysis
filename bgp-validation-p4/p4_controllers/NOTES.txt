The thrift generated files were generated from the bmv2 source with the following command:

thrift -o . --gen py -r bmv2/thrift_src/standard.thrift
thrift -o . --gen py -r bmv2/thrift_src/simple_pre.thrift
thrift -o . --gen py -r bmv2/thrift_src/simple_pre_lag.thrift
thrift -o . --gen py -r bmv2/targets/simple_switch/thrift/simple_switch.thrift

The output is taken from the gen-py folder. 

A script does this automatically; to make sure that the thrift types are 
compatible with your installed version of bmv2, delete the bundled bm_runtime and sswitch_runtime
folders, then run generate_thrift_deps.sh in the p4_controllers folder.
